## Welcome

Aviation incident and accident data is extensive, involving various contributing factors. This code aims to facilitate the understanding of this data by seeking correlations between such factors.

Firstly, it is important to define how the database will be processed. From the presented samples, data is separated based on whether it affects flight safety or not, meaning a "classification" problem with categorical or qualitative output.
